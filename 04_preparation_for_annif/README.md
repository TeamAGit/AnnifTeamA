# README

The notebook "preparation_for_annif.ipynb" prepares data for Annif:
* "records_for_step_03_train_project_annif.tsv" is for 03_train_project.
* A folder "docs" (gitignored!) for step 07. For each record, the folder contains: 
	+ a tsv file containing the RVK notation and its description
	+ a txt file containing the text to be analysed by Annif (as of 2023-08-22 this is discipline + keywords + title; no table of contents yet!)
